HOW TO USE:

2. Free Stopwatch saves the time lapses as txt-files. Make own folder to these files. Copy the path of the folder.
3. Open aikalaskuri.py with any IDE. Replace the value "?" of the variable named 'path' with the path of your time lapse folder.
4. Run the program. It prints the total time into the IDE terminal.
